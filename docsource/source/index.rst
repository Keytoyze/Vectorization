ULTRA is a toolkit for unbiased/online learning to rank algorithms. It was developed with a focus on facilitating the designing, comparing and sharing of unbiased/online learning to rank algorithms. There are a number of unbiased/online learning to rank algorithms, such as IPWrank, DLA, RegressionEM, DBGD, PDGD, and PairwiseDebias, designed with a unified interface. It also have a number of ranking models that support gradient descent optimizations, such as DNN, linear regression, DLCM, GSF, and SetRank. We are always happy to receive any code contributions, suggestions, and comments.
